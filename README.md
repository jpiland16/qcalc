# qCalc

a simple calculator for those who use quaternions often

## The interface

 - An identity quaternion is stored in memory, shown in purple at the top of the screen.
 - Using a keyboard or the provided common quantities, enter the X, Y, Z, and W components of a new quaternion.
 - Pressing the equals (=) key will (right-)multiply the quaternion in memory by the quaternion just entered.

   > In other words: *qMem*<sub>new</sub> = *qMem* * *qEntry*

 - The invert button inverts the current quaternion in memory.
